This is where we can put comments on how the build is going as well as post issues/solutions

When creating the derby database we ran into a few issues.

Major issue is that we were creating the table but nothing was inside the table after reading the csv file
	We had forgotten to add the user we pulled the info into to the userList
	Which meant the table had nothing in it because we passed nothing into it

Another issue we ran into was locating the database
	When you create the table in the database make sure to refresh the project in eclipse
	Sometimes they will not show up

Cannot find derby databse
	Make sure the project build path is referencing the deby database

Overall database implementation took about 2 hours and 30 minutes
